/*
 * clnt_tcp.c, Implements a TCP/IP based, client side RPC.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 1984, Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 *
 * TCP based RPC supports 'batched calls'.
 * A sequence of calls may be batched-up in a send buffer.  The rpc call
 * return immediately to the client even though the call was not necessarily
 * sent.  The batching occurs if the results' xdr routine is NULL (0) AND
 * the rpc timeout value is zero (see clnt.h, rpc).
 *
 * Clients should NOT casually batch calls that in fact return results; that is,
 * the server side should be aware that a call is batched and not produce any
 * return message.  Batched calls that produce many result messages can
 * deadlock (netlock) the client and the server....
 *
 * Now go hang yourself.
